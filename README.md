Rules for translation
---------------------
Translation of buttons on FirstPage has to be NOT longer than 7 symbols (better 4-5 symbols).  
Examples:
- `Save as` - maximal length
- `Save` - optimal length  
If you can not do translation of buttons short try solution of @rabauke - empty the tranclation context.
